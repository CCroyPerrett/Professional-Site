<h2>Implimentation/New Changes</h2>
<p>
    For this assignment, I have implimented a number of general improvents onto my program for better usage and functionality.
    a number of these features are as follows. <br>

    Using the newly added "Object Opacity slider, one may change the opacity of any given object (indipendant of any others), allowing other objects or the 
    background to be seen through it. The "Lines toggle beside it can be used to deactivate the wireframe lines, as to provide a 
    more smooth and "ghost like" see through effect.

    At the bottom of the page, the background has additional features, with the rendering of the axis now able to be disabled/enabled,
    adnthe color of the background changed with the associated sliders.

    Animation functionality has been expanded. With the activation of the Animation toggles, the camera can now automatically rotate
    around the scene with the associated toggles.

    With the new "RESET SOR" button at the top of the screen, one may clear the upper "drawing canvas", allowing for the creation of new
    surfaces of rotation (with new lines of rotation) to be created and inserted into the scene. (NOTE: The lower canvas will not Animate
    while the lines of a new SOR are being drawn. Finish creating the new SOR to resume scene animation.)

<h2>Program Wide Documentation</h2>
<p>I made this program without the help of external libraries, including the ones we were allowed to use. Although it did make it more
    difficult to program certain features, I felt that I woould learn more about the base mathematics behind computer graphics if i was made to
    reconstruct these systems at a lower level. Although I was unable to impliment pixel perfect object clipping, I am satisfied with the
    rendering tool I have created, and how it deepened my understanding in computer graphics. The program will now be fully explained from top to bottom.

    At the top of the scene will be the "Drawing Canvas", in which the player may click points to form a line to be used to create a surfaceof rotation.
    Once the line is drawn, the SOF can materialize through the "Create" button, reset throught the "Reset" button (to draw a new SOF), and inserted into the lower world with
    the "Insert" button. The color and #of rotations may be costumized through their respective options, and the object viewed and different angles through
    the "rotation" slider.

    Below, will be the "World Canvas", in which the SORs may be manuvered. Settings for the world may be found directly underneath, enabling a veriety
    of shading and lighting options, in addition to the background color. Following are edit options for specific objects, which they may be transformed, scaled &
    rotated, in addition to opacity options. Finally, the camera options, in which the entire view of the scene may be moved, rotated, or even activley animated. Here
    one may select between Orthogonal or Perspective view (the former of which has far away objects maintin their visible size, & the latter makes them appear smaller).

    This was a deep learning experince, and I am satisfied with the experince I have now gained. I had no idea the layers of complexity that lay behind seemingly 'simple'
    object representation, and I am eager to but this knowledge to use in future projects.
