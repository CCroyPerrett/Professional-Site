<h2>Implimentation</h2>
<p>
    For this assignment, I have allowed one to create a scene containing multiple variations of an surface of rotation,
    genereated with the technology developed in the previous assignment. Same as before, one may generate the object of rotation
    by left-clicking the top canvas, and finish on a right-click. One one is done designing the curve, they may generate the SOR
    with the "Create Surface of Rotation" button. Additionally, after an object is created, one may interface with a veriety of
    lighting & shading options to display them in greater detail. <br>
    
    Under the world canvas, above the options to transform existing objects are now new options to edit the may in which light
    and shading are represented. The given shading options, being "Wireframe", "Flat Shading" & "Gourand Shading" may be
    enabled with their given buttons, and are mutually exclusive. <br>
    
    The giving lighting options, being "Directional", "Point"
    and "Ambient" may be used to add light sources of those types, with the location of the point lighting being able to
    be changes with the new bars at the bottom of the page. Additionally, "Specular" may be enabled to cause the directional
    and point lighting sources to give a mettalic sheen to the object.<br>

    Note: The Gourand Shading option, while partially complete, is prone to visual errors due to both time constraints, and 
    poor coding practice on my part in previous assignments making it more difficult to get the adjacent polygons to a vertex
    on my part. It still calculates vertex normals and impliments gradients to create a more multifaceted shading effect, as a proper
    gourand shading should, I just had not had the time to investigate the more obscure data collection errors. Hence, I ask my 
    efforts for such on the Gourand Shading be awarded partial credit.<br>

    Depicted below are several images of the program, meant to display its usage. 
    The first and third pictures display a point light, with and without specular effects respectivley. Note that 
    this is a light blue object, and the orange color of the lighting is giving it a more "off tone" appearance.
    The third and fourth photos showcase a similar object, of the same color, but now under the white directional light
    (both with and without specular effects). Also note how the specular effects are weaker on the point light,
    as to balance out potental eyesores that may occur while using both point and directional light with specular effects at the same time. </p>
